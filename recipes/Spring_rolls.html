        <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the outer coating of the roll, take a large bowl and add plain flour, cornflour, water, salt and whisk the ingredients well.</li>
            <li>Also, ensure that no lumps are formed and the consistency of the batter should be balanced. Take a non-stick pan and heat it on medium flame. Then, grease it with some oil. Once the pan is hot enough, pour a ladleful of the batter into it and make a thin pancake by tilting the pan.</li>
            <li>Let it cook on medium flame till the sides start to peel off. Once the sides start to peel off, transfer the pancake on to a plate. Do not cook the other side. Follow this process with the remaining batter and stack the wrappers together with a sprinkle of flour in between, keeping the cooked side on top.</li>
            <li>Now take a wok with 1 tbsp oil in it and heat it over high flame.Once the oil is hot, add in the following ingredients- carrots, capsicum, onion, cabbage, ginger and stir fry till they become slightly tender but still have a crunch.Finally add in the salt, soya, pepper and give it a stir. Let the mixture dry up.Now take a kadai/wok with 1 tbsp oil in it and heat it over high flame.Once the oil is hot, add in the following ingredients- carrots, capsicum, onion, cabbage, ginger and stir fry till they become slightly tender but still have a crunch.Finally add in the salt, soya, pepper and give it a stir. Let the mixture dry up.</li>
            <li>Remove the wok from the stove and transfer the filling mixture onto a plate. Let this mixture cool down. Now, place the spring roll wrappers on a flat surface with uncooked side out and apply some flour paste to the corners. Place 1 tablespoon of the filling mixture on the cooked side of the pancake, at one end. Fold 1/2 inch from the left side and then the right side. Roll upwards holding the sides.</li>
            <li>Note that the edges should be sealed well with the flour paste so that it doesn't crack when the roll is deep fried. Repeat this process for all the spring rolls and keep aside.Take a heavy bottomed pot/pan and pour enough oil to deep fry. Deep fry the spring rolls till golden brown. Turn off the heat and transfer the dish to a serving plate. Serve hot with ketchup/chilli sauce.</li>
