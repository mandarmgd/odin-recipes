# odin-recipes
This project serves as my first step towards the world of web development. It consists of three recipes to some of my favourite dishes, each of which could be accessed through the index page. It demonstrates all the skills I've learned so far, namely lists, links, images, headings and paragraphs. It has also helped me improve my understanding of github and its features as it has taught me the significance of staging and committing your files from time-to-time and to find the right timing to do so.

I have put all the recipes in a separate folder simply titled 'recipes'. Each dish has been provided with a small description, followed by the ingredients required to make them and the steps to be followed. I've also added an image to each recipe. I've used lists to display ingredients and steps neatly and effectively, headings to differentiate between the content written and paragraphs for content writing.

I've also made some changes to the project using CSS concepts, such as classes, text and image properties.
